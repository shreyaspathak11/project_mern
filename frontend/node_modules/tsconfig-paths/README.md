Use this to load modules whose location is specified in the `paths` section of `tsconfig.json`. Both loading at run-time and via API are supported.

Typescript by default mimics the Node.js runtime resolution strategy of modules. But it also allows the use of [path mapping](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/module-resolution.html) which allows arbitrary module paths (that doesn't start with "/" or ".") to be specified and mapped to physical paths in the filesystem. The typescript compiler can resolve these paths from `tsconfig` so it will compile OK. But if you then try to execute the compiled files with node (or ts-node), it will only look in the `node_modules` folders all the way up to the root of the filesystem and thus will not find the modules specified by `paths` in `tsconfig`.

If you require this package's `tsconfig-paths/register` module it will read the `paths` from `tsconfig.json` and convert node's module loading calls into to physcial file paths that node can load.

## How to install

```
yarn add --dev tsconfig-paths
```

or

```
npm install --save-dev tsconfig-paths
```

## How to use

### With node

`node -r tsconfig-paths/register main.js`

### With ts-node

`ts-node -r tsconfig-paths/register main.ts`

If `process.env.TS_NODE_PROJECT` is set it will be used to resolved tsconfig.json

### With webpack

For webpack please use the [tsconfig-paths-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/dividab/tsconfig-paths-webpack-plugin).

### With mocha and ts-node

As of Mocha >= 4.0.0 the `--compiler` was [deprecated](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/wiki/compilers-deprecation). Instead `--require` should be used. You also have to specify a glob that includes `.ts` files because mocha looks after files with `.js` extension by default.

```bash
mocha -r ts-node/register -r tsconfig-paths/register "test/**/*.ts"
```

### With other commands

As long as the command has something similar to a `--require` option that can load a module before it starts, tsconfig-paths should be able to work with it.

## Bootstraping with explicit params

If you want more granular control over tsconfig-paths you can bootstrap it. This can be useful if you for instance have compiled with `tsc` to another directory where `tsconfig.json` doesn't exists.

```javascript
const tsCo
