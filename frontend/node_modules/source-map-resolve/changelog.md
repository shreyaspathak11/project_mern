### Version 0.6.0 (2020-03-21) ###

- Removed: The browser version. Only Node.js is now supported.
- Improved: Three old, weird, tiny dependencies were inlined, which should
  decrease install size.

### Version 0.5.3 (2019-12-28) ###

- Fixed: base64 encoded source maps now correctly decodes as utf-8. Previously,

### Version 0.5.0 (2016-02-28) ###

- Improved: Errors now have a `sourceMapData` property that contain as much as
